## User Experience (UX)

-   ### User stories

    -   #### First Time Visitor Goals

        -   As a first-time user I want to know the main purpose of the site immediately upon arriving on the site.
        -   As a first-time user, I want first time impressions to be appealing, the idea being that it won't intimidate the user with an overload of content.
        -   As a first-time user I want the site UX to be intuitive for ease of use. I want the user to be able to easily navigate throughout the site to find content and services the user is looking for.
        
    -   #### Returning Visitor Goals

        -   As a returning user, I want to be able to register with the site and create my own profile which I can log in to at any time.
        -   As a returning user, I want to be able to add football books of my own to the site.
        -   As a returning user, I want to be able to edit/delete any book contributions I have made to the site.
        -   As a user I want the site to be responsive to all devices.
        
-   ### Design

    -   #### Structure
    
        -   The structure of the website was purposely designed to maintain a fluid, consistent display throughout as to not look cluttered, easy to navigate and easy to find what you are looking for.
        
        -   Website Colors and Font: Website colors and font remain consistent throughout.
    
    -   #### Colour Scheme
    
        -   The color scheme I was aiming for on my website is simple, easy on the eye and appealing. I kept the colors simple and I feel that the contrast works. 
        
       <h2 align="center"><img src="https://github.com/Elippsis007/football_shelf_m3/blob/main/static/images/color_pallette.png"></h2>
            
    -   #### Typography
    
        -   [Bree Serif](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Bree+Serif?query=bree) is the main font used throughout the whole website with San-serif as the fallback font in                   case for any reason the font isn't being recognized on different operating systems. Bree Serif is a professional looking font, it has characteristics that speak                 "professional", I like the shape and the style of the font, and I feel it represents the professionalism I am looking to create.

### Testing User Stories from User Experience (UX) Section

-   #### First Time Visitor Goals

    1. As a user, I want the Home page to be attractive, simple with a little vibrance from the colors. When the user enters for the first time they are not exposed to clutter and confusion.
    
        1. When the user is exploring the website, they will see the Bruna Fernandes logo on ALL pages on the navbar and sometimes a banner toward the top of the page centered.
        2. The website uses cool, and slightly illuminated colors to give a fresh vibrancy feel to the pages. The Member's page was altered to a gold color, for that VIP status feeling, highlighting the best of the best for loyal clients.
            
    2. As a user, I want to be able to easily navigate throughout the site to find information and services they are looking for.
        
        1. The site has been designed to be fluid and never to entrap or confuse the user. At the top of each page there is a clean navigation bar, each link tells the user which the page they be redirected to and some of the links have a drop-down with further options to choose from.
        2. Toward the bottom of all the pages there are social links that will redirect you to the various social media platforms opening a new tab for each link.

        1. On the services link the user can go straight to Physiotherapy and Pilates page, where they can learn a little about what is on offer to new or existing clients.
        2. Three sections to this page are Physiotherapy, Pilates and the unique service of Home visits.
        3. Toward the bottom of the page are the social medial links.

        1. The user can access the Contact page where they can submit their messages, comments and feedback.
        2. There is a fully functional form with inputs for your Name, Email and a message box for your comments.
        3. The user receives a popup when the message has successfully been sent and a message to tell the user when a message has NOT been sent.
        4. There is also a section for a user who may have missed the appointment section a link to go to appointments for the user convenience.
        5. The final section is an address and contact number followed by Google maps with a pin to locate Bruna Fernandes office.
