## User Experience (UX)

-   ### User stories

    -   #### First Time Visitor Goals

        -   As a first-time user I want to know the main purpose of the site immediately upon arriving on the site.
        -   As a first-time user, I want first time impressions to be appealing, the idea being that it won't intimidate the user with an overload of content.
        -   As a first-time user I want the site UX to be intuitive for ease of use. I want the user to be able to easily navigate throughout the site to find content and services the user is looking for.
        
    -   #### Returning Visitor Goals

        -   As a returning user, I want to be able to register with the site and create my own profile which I can log in to at any time.
        -   As a returning user, I want to be able to add football books of my own to the site.
        -   As a returning user, I want to be able to edit/delete any book contributions I have made to the site.
        -   As a user I want the site to be responsive to all devices.
        
-   ### Design

    -   #### Structure
    
        -   The structure of the website was purposely designed to maintain a fluid, consistent display throughout as to not look cluttered, easy to navigate and easy to find what you are looking for.
        
        -   Website Colors and Font: Website colors and font remain consistent throughout.
    
    -   #### Colour Scheme
    
        -   The color scheme I was aiming for on my website is simple, easy on the eye and appealing. I kept the colors simple and I feel that the contrast works. 
        
       <h2 align="center"><img src="https://github.com/Elippsis007/football_shelf_m3/blob/main/static/images/color_pallette.png"></h2>
            
    -   #### Typography
    
        -   [Bree Serif](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Bree+Serif?query=bree) is the main font used throughout the whole website with San-serif as the fallback font in                   case for any reason the font isn't being recognized on different operating systems. Bree Serif is a professional looking font, it has characteristics that speak                 "professional", I like the shape and the style of the font, and I feel it represents the professionalism I am looking to create.

1. Log in to GitHub and locate the [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/)
2. At the top of the Repository (not top of page) just above the "Settings" Button on the menu, locate the "Fork" Button.
3. You should now have a copy of the original repository in your GitHub account.

### Making a Local Clone

1. Log in to GitHub and locate the [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/)
2. Under the repository name, click "Clone or download".
3. To clone the repository using HTTPS, under "Clone with HTTPS", copy the link.
4. Open Git Bash
5. Change the current working directory to the location where you want the cloned directory to be made.
6. Type `git clone`, and then paste the URL you copied in Step 3.

```
$ git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/YOUR-REPOSITORY
```

7. Press Enter. Your local clone will be created.

```
$ git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/YOUR-REPOSITORY
> Cloning into `CI-Clone`...
> remote: Counting objects: 10, done.
> remote: Compressing objects: 100% (8/8), done.
> remove: Total 10 (delta 1), reused 10 (delta 1)
> Unpacking objects: 100% (10/10), done.
```
