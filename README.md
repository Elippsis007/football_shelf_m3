    -   #### Structure
    
        -   The structure of the website was purposely designed to maintain a fluid, consistent display throughout as to not look cluttered, easy to navigate and easy to find                 what you are looking for.
        
    -   #### Pages: All pages contained the following elements.
        -   Header/Footer: Defining clean and simple navigation to what the user is looking for.

        <h2 align="center"><img src="https://github.com/Elippsis007/bruna_fernandes_phsiotherapy_m2/blob/master/assets/website_screens/navbar_screenshot.png?raw=true"></h2>
        <h2 align="center"><img src="https://github.com/Elippsis007/bruna_fernandes_phsiotherapy_m2/blob/master/assets/website_screens/footer_screenshot.png?raw=true"></h2>       
        
        -   Website Brand Logo: On all pages the Brand logo sits on the Navbar and is a clickable link to redirect to the homepage.
        <h2 align="center"><img src="https://github.com/Elippsis007/bruna_fernandes_phsiotherapy_m2/blob/master/assets/website_screens/logo_screenshot.png?raw=true"></h2>
        -   Website Colors and Font: Website colors and font remain consistent throughout.
    
    -   #### Colour Scheme
    
        -   The color scheme on my website was based off the business card from Bruna's private practice where I wanted to keep it consistent throughout and where it was                 clean and simple and appealing to look at. I used a "mint green" trim color with a dark blue background across all pages for consistency. The member's page was                   colored in gold representing the status of members, VIP, etc.
        
       <h2 align="center"><img src="https://github.com/Elippsis007/bruna_fernandes_phsiotherapy_m2/blob/master/assets/colors/palette_colors.png?raw=true"></h2>
            
    -   #### Typography
    
        -   [Bree Serif](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Bree+Serif?query=bree) is the main font used throughout the whole website with San-serif as the fallback font in                   case for any reason the font isn't being recognized on different operating systems. Bree Serif is a professional looking font, it has characteristics that speak                 "professional", I like the shape and the style of the font, and I feel it represents the professionalism I am looking to create.
        
    -   #### Imagery
   
        -   Imagery in this website is clear and intuitive for learning purposes

## Google Maps API

### What is the Google Maps Platform?
The Google Maps Platform is a set of APIs and SDKs that allows developers to embed Google Maps into mobile apps and web pages, or to retrieve data from Google Maps.

The Maps API returns helpful data about places and locations. It is called by javascript.
It does two major things:
-   It can cause maps to appear for the user.
-   It can return data about a latitude/longitude location, or return data about an address.

Google's documentation is strong for this API, so this guide will mostly link to the official documentation, and discuss how Refuge uses the different API features.

### For a general introduction, see:

-   https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/ and
-   https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/tutorial

### Why do we use Google Maps? (What is is good for?)
As an app that locates restrooms, we need a way to handle both addresses (e.g. 1 Embarcadero Center, San Francisco, CA) and physical locations (latitude + longitude). Otherwise we wouldn't be able to keep track of our restrooms properly, and the app wouldn't work. Google Maps does what we need, and it was the first thing Refuge was developed with.

It also lets us request an address from Google (we give them a physical location (latitude and longitude), they turn it into an address); We can do the reverse, by giving Google an address, and requesting a physical location (latitude and longitude). Try searching from the homepage to see this in action.

We can also get information about businesses, landmarks, restaurants, etc. from the Google Maps "Places" library. This info includes when they open/close each day, for example.

### Making a Local Clone

1. Log in to GitHub and locate the [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/)
2. Under the repository name, click "Clone or download".
3. To clone the repository using HTTPS, under "Clone with HTTPS", copy the link.
4. Open Git Bash
5. Change the current working directory to the location where you want the cloned directory to be made.
6. Type `git clone`, and then paste the URL you copied in Step 3.

```
$ git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/YOUR-REPOSITORY
```

7. Press Enter. Your local clone will be created.

```
$ git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/YOUR-REPOSITORY
> Cloning into `CI-Clone`...
> remote: Counting objects: 10, done.
> remote: Compressing objects: 100% (8/8), done.
> remove: Total 10 (delta 1), reused 10 (delta 1)
> Unpacking objects: 100% (10/10), done.
```
