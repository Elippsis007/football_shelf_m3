Heroku setup

1. Telling Heroku what applications and dependencies are required to run our Flask app

3. Procfile: A file Heroku looks for and to know which file runs the app, and how to
run it.
Command: echo web: python app.py > Procfile


Connecting Flask to MongoDB

1. A working connection between your application and your database
2. It allows your application to programmatically perform CRUD actions on your database (e.g. so your application can read in your data)
3. Connect your database and application by using a database URL. To help Flask talk to Mongo, you'll install a library called flask-pymongo.

Command: pip3 install flask-pymongo


Installing dnspython

1. This is required so I can use the Mongo SRV connection string

Command: pip3 install dnspython


Requirements.txt

1. Important that I remember to update the requirements.txt file when installing new packages
